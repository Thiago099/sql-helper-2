# sql-helper-2
Graphic interface that makes it a lot easier to build SQL queries.

First, you select a database and table.

Then you click on the tables on the left side to move them to the right side, to select them to use in the query. Once you add a table the program will scan the database for foreign keys that the table has (cyan) and foreign keys that reference that table (pink), those will appear on the left side.

Finally, you select which fields do you want, and define alias to the fields and tables (duplicated table alias will appear in red).

Also now there is a menu to select the database connections, if you don't click on save added connections will only be available in the current session.
